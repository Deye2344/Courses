Each chapter ends with case studies and accompanying exercises. Authored by experts in industry and academia, the case studies explore key chapter concepts and verify understanding through increasingly challenging exercises. Instructors should find the case studies sufficiently detailed and robust to allow them to create their own additional exercises. Brackets for each exercise chapter section indicate the text sections of primary relevance to completing the exercise. We hope this helps readers to avoid exercises for which they havenâ€™t read the corresponding section, in addition to providing the source for review. Exercises are rated, to give the reader a sense of the amount of time required to complete an exercise

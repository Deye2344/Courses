Builder's notes
===============

1. On some systems (notably NetBSD), the yacc of parsedate.y 
   produces a .c file with the tokens #defined _after_ they
   are used.  The file parsedate.c.save is provided as a
   a substitute and reference.
2. The library depends on the availability of a regular 
   expression package for filtering.  Where the old regex
   package (re_comp, re_exec) is unavailable (e.g., NetBSD),
   we use the POSIX-compliant regex (regcomp, regexec).


Include File Organization
=========================

functions, constants, etc. that are exported to the user are
	in tracelib.h
functions, constants, etc. that are library-internal but 
	used between library modules are in *.h, where
	* is the defining module name
functions, constants, etc. private to a module are in *_private.h.

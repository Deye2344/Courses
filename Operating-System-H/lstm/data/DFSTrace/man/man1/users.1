.SH NAME
users -- print active uids in a trace


.SH SYNOPSIS
 

.nf

users [ -v ] [ -d ] [ -f filterfile ] file

.fi 

.PP

.SH DESCRIPTION
 
users classifies the records in the trace \fIfile\fR by the uid that
produced them, and prints a table consisting of each uid found in the
trace, the number of records found to be generated by that uid, and
the percentage of the records in the trace that represents.  It is not
always possible to identify the user responsible for generating a
trace record.  The uid of a process is only recorded in the FORK record
for that process.   If the process was running before the trace
started, and created no child processes during the trace, then the uid
that generated those records is unknown.   The number and percentage of
records belonging to ``unknown'' uids is also reported.
